Algorithm for adding user

Step 1: Take the username

Step 2: Check if the user exists in the Local Storage

Step 3: If user does not exists, ask to make a new user and give him a fresh dashboard for entering his note

Step 4: If user exists, fetch the username from the localstorage and save the username in the notes object like title, id, text etc,
        let Obj = {
            title: heading.value,
            text: addText.value,
            imp: Number(imp.checked),
            user: user
        }

Step 5: if the logged in user == user in the note object, show that note.
